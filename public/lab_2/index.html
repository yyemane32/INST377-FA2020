        </h1>
        <p>Dear Dover,<br>
            Thank you for your recent application to join us at UMD's iSchool to study for your undergraduate in 2020.I will answer your questions one by one, in <br> the following sections.
           
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        </p>

        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a <br> semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li> First semester: <time datetime="2020-02-14">"29 August 2020"</time>.</li>
                <li>Second semester:<time datetime="2020-02-14">"22 January 2021"</time>.</li>
                <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2020-02-14">"2 May 2021"</time>.</li>
            </ul>
        </p> 
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. <br>
            You can find more information about <a href="http://reslife.umd.edu/movein/dates"> important university dates</a> on our website/</p>

        <h2>
            Subjects of study
        </h2>

        <P>
            At the iSchool, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of information studies. You seem <br> like a committed researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br> by are as follows, in order of priority:
            <ol type = "1">
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 33°C (91.4°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                <li> <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
             </ol>
        </P>

        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other <br> resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

            Animals of the Extended Perambulation
        </h2>

        <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study animals. To answer your question, my favourite creatures are as follows, with <br> definitions:
        </p>

        <p>
            <dl>
                <dt>The Canadian Polar bear</dt>
                <dd> A large predator, <em>very</em> hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely on seal.</dd>
                <dt> The elk</dt>
                <dd>An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the mountainous regions of British Columbia. It can be seen from railways, and also frequently visits the Banff centre for the arts.</dd>
                <dt>The red-tailed hawk</dt>
                <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation: many people believe eagles make the screaming noise associated with them on film. This cry is instead the call of the red-tail.</dd>
              </dl> <br>
            
              For more of my research, see my <a href= "http://umd.edu"> research page </a> <br>

              <br>
              Yours sincerely,
              <br>
